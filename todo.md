# TODO

## Dev TODO

- docker-compose to run
- starter test data
- linting for JavaScript
- why do the prod logs say
    'Downloading 'tailwindcss-linux-x64' from
    <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-lint -->
    '<https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/download/tailwindcss-linux-x64>
- make videos smaller on upload (maybe?)
- don't rely on browser focus for posts anymore
- don't crash when I search for "animals

### Features TODO

- allow changing the default volume of videos
- allow changing time of token expiry
- allow users to choose whether to hide video controls
- make video controls disapper after playing for a while
  (or maybe somehow make controls be outside the video?)
- make input elements multi-row for long titles (also maybe make title text smaller)
